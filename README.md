# QueryGenie

ðŸª„ QueryGenie is a Streamlit-based AI-powered SQLite assistant that lets you upload SQLite databases and interact with them using natural language queries. It generates valid SQLite SQL queries using Cohere's API, executes **read-only** queries, and shows results inline in a modern chat UI with dark mode.
